# 32-bit-ISA-2-pass-assembler
Designed a 32-bit ISA and implemented a two pass assembler using C code to demonstrate assembly language computations.


MANUAL TO USE THE ISA 
THE PROGRAMS
PROGRAM 1 ::	Find frequency of a given number in an integer array
PROGRAM 2 ::	Binary Search for an integer


PART 1 :: FROM ASSEMBLY CODE TO BINARY
How to use ?
=>Extract everything to the single folder 
=>Put the assembly code in ‘input_instructions.txt’
=>Run main and give the base address as 200 (or any value much lesser than 1024)
=>Output machine code is found in ‘output_machine_code.txt’
NOTE :: Pre-run inputs and outputs can be found ‘Assembly CODE 1’(‘Assembly CODE 2’) and ‘Output Code1’(‘Output Code2’)
Abstract Explanation of Algorithm
STEP1::  Opcodes along with their assigned machine codes and expected operand formats
i.e.
/**
        rri = reg reg imm. addr.
        rrr = reg reg reg
        ri  = reg imm.
        rr  = reg reg
        a   = add
        z   = zero
        */

 are read from ‘input_opcode.txt’ by the program and are stored as a HASH TABLE( to reduce time complexity while searching for those opcodes)
/*We have used 2 pass assembler to  remove forward addressing problem*/

STEP2:: In pass 1, a symbol table of all labels  is generated which can be read in ‘symbol_table.txt’


STEP3::In pass 2, the program in again read and symbol table is used to get the corresponding addresses associated with each label. Each instruction is converted to 32 bit machine code

PART 2 :: FROM BINARY CODE TO EXECUTION
How to use ? (similar to previous file)
/*Use testbit.c with gcc -lm*/
Abstract Explanation of Algorithm
We are storing the opcodes in a Binary Trie .
Thus we have refrained from storing the machine codes corresponding to opcodes in additional space. This data structure saves huge amount of memory since no machine code is actually being stored.  

 



The searching also takes place using this trie. Thus, we have implemented the most optimized scheme of 
 Using trie, search complexities can be brought to most optimal limit (opcode length). This guarantees search in O(p) time where p is the length of the largest opcode. This scheme is much better than trial and error using masking in both time and space complexities.
 
The opcodes corresponding to the machine instruction is extracted and executed.
